A data-driven project that uses machine learning to predict extreme weather events and assess their economic impact across Europe

# 🌍 Prediction of Extreme Weather Events and Their Economic Impact in Europe

This project uses machine learning and climate data to predict extreme weather events and evaluate their potential economic consequences across Europe.

## 📌 Project Overview

Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves. These events can cause significant economic disruption. This project aims to:

- Predict the occurrence of extreme weather events using historical climate data.
- Estimate their economic impact by country and event type.
- Provide visualizations and insights through an interactive dashboard.
